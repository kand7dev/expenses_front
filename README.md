# Special-Topics-in-Software-Engineering
This is a To-Do List application created by me, Antonisvar and kand7dev for a university project in the course of Special Topics in Software Engineering.

#Description:
We will have to design and develop a business application of CRUD type, three levels (front-end, business logic, database) on a small scale. By "small scale" we mean that it is not necessary to deal with all possible functions of such an application but to select 3-4 of those that are important, at your discretion. After all, the aim of the task is not is not only the software to be produced but also the development methodology.

## A. Development Methodology
Î¤he design and development should follow the principles of agile development i.e. at a minimum, the requirements will be in user stories, there should be a product backlog and a board for each sprint. T
The tool that we will use for project management (in their free version) is Trello.

## B. System Architecture
As mentioned above, our application will have three layers (front-end, business logic, database).
The constraints we will follow are 
(a) The front-end will communicate with the business logic using RESTful web services 
(b) the business logic is based on an object-oriented language programming language
(c) the database must be relational and
(d) the business logic must communicate with the database via ORM.
